# ParallelSBTree

Parallel(Self-Balancing)Tree utilized Thread (from threading) parallelization to run 1 function
over a large Dataset stored as a BTree.

## Future Development

* upgrade to Cython written BTree for faster access and memory control
* Threading control as to not create too many threads that hinders performance
* suppport  pickle for already loaded trees for faster loading
* support for vector-like objects (Arrays, Matrices)
* support OpenCl
